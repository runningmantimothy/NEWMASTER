Putting up a school that will provide quality education at an affordable rate has been the lifelong dream of the indefatigable 
Mrs. Guia B. Urrutia, the School's Executive Vice President. With the full support of her husband, the generous Mr. Philip C. Urrutia,
and her children, NUESTRA SEÑORA DE GUIA LEARNING CENTER was born. Being both educators, Sir Philip and Ma’am Ging,as
both were affectionately called, they knew what they wanted for the school. As a devotee of the Virgin of Ermita Church,
Nuestra Señora de Guia, Ma’am Ging deemed it fit to name her school the same.With an initial enrollment of fourteen (14) pupils
and a teacher, the school started operating for the SY 1999-2000. From there the school never looked back.Enrollment has grown
from leaps and bounds and each year, the school adds another level. At present, the school offers the complete pre-elementary,
elementary, and first year and second year high school levels. Committed to the delivery of quality education at affordable
rates, the school continues improving the quality of instruction. Aside from the core competencies, the school also offers computer
education for all levels to prepare the students for the digital age. In addition, the school has also put up a speech laboratory
to hone the students in the mastery of the English language. Plans are also in place to further improve the school facilities within
the next few years.With faith and inspiration from the Blessed Virgin Mary, NUESTRA SEÑORA DE GUIA LEARNING CENTER looks 
forward to serving the community and the country for years to come. For this reason, the name of the school was changed to 
NUESTRA SEÑORA DE GUIA ACADEMY OF MARIKINA this June, 2010.</td>
